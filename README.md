# CHE_search_paper

GitHub repository containing the main codes used to produce the paper 'Search for black hole hyperbolic encounters with gravitational wave detectors'. Namely the code to run the correlation trigger on the experimental data (allDataQrrelationTrigger.py), the code to run the correlation trigger on the shifted data (shiftedallDataQrrelationTrigger.py), the code to inject CHE simulations into shifted timestream and run the correlation trigger over it (gnrl_three_injectionSampleGenerator.py) and the code to analyze the images using a Neural Network (ResNet_O2_Data.py)

The codes have been run using version 1.18.0 of pycbc and version 2.5.0 of tensorflow.
